# SQLite practice application

Build me a simple SQLite application in golang

It should have the following endpoints

- GET `user/` returns all users
- POST `user/` create a new user

- Use gin for HTTP requests
- Use clean architecture
- DON'T USE GORM (use normal sqlite package)
  
For the front-end

It's just a single page with the form at the top and a list of all users below it.

For CSS use

- rounded borders
- shadow
- bootstrap
